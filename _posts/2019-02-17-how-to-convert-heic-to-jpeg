If you've tried to download and use pictures taken from your recent iOS device on a non-Apple system that it may not recognize 
Apple's new picture format. A quick Google search reveals lots of online option but you might not be comfortable uploading your
personal pictures to some website just to convert them. Fear not! There is a way to convert them locally on your computer. Note
that I am showing this option from a Mac's perspective but it would a very similar setup from any other Linux/Unix system.

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed and set up on your system, install `imagemagick`:

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```

Once installed, you can convert your .HEIC pictures using the following command:

```bash
convert IMG.HEIC IMG.JPEG
```

Voila!
