We would like to welcome you to log(n), a blog hosted by LOGN, LLC and aiming
at providing our readers with relevant information about JavaScript, Ruby on
Rails and Python.

Even though we already have experience designing and developing
complex dashboards and data visualizations, we are starting an effort towards
expanding our knowledge of data science. We will share our journey with you as
we explore this new field and learn an exciting new language,
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
